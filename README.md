# Product_Feature_Extractor
The Product Feature Extractor project aims to use generative AI to  extract product-specific features like “camera quality” or “battery life”  from user reviews. These insights can help businesses enhance their  offerings based on real user feedback. It leverages large language  models and prompt-based extraction via the FLAN-T5 model.
